Northcoders News

Northcoders News is a Reddit-style news application. It sorts a list of articles by topic, highest-voted or most recently added. The user can vote on the articles, post new articles, vote on the comments and post new comments. It should be noted that only logged in users can post articles and comments.

It is very straightforward to log in - simply peruse the articles and comments for an existing username and use this as input.

A full list of the endpoints can be found in the [backend repo](https://github.com/EllieBeveridge/Northcoder-News-EB).
